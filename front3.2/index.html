            <p>Your summary is an introduction that sets the tone for the rest of your resume. It is intended to
                provide a broad overview of your professional background. It should emphasize the skills, experience
                and knowledge that you can offer a potential employer. Try to focus on a single main idea that
                shows why you're the perfect fit for the job.</p>
